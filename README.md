#MixIt
MixIt is a project done in under 36 hours during the hackupc22! It's a simple and addictive game in which you will have 30 seconds to match the color given mixing the palette colors. you will have to bring out the artist in you!

This project was the first hackathon for all the team members. The main challenge we had is that none of us had never done anything with *JavaScript*, *HTML* or *CSS* languages before, so we had to start from zero and learning everyting through the way.
